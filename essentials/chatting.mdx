## Crafting the Narrative

NB2 is designed to take your inputs and provide structured narratives that better fit what you want to communicate. The inputs themselves can be statements, bullets, or general blurbs about activities, achievements, or challenges (e.g. "Led a team meeting focused on productivity improvements). After submitting your input, NB2 will process it to provide a structured statement for your review and editing. Each "Workshop" is built to develop a single narrative, which enables the user to sort and manage statements efficiently.

### Common Usecase Problems

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Statement Lengths">
  Large Language Models aren't great at character counting, so there is a little song and dance to making it work.
  `Can you make the statement longer OR can you make the statement shorter`
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Another bug">
```java NewBug.java
    public static void somedayWeWill(Find[] anotherBug) {
        int currentBugCount = 0;
        return currentBugCount;
    }
  ```
